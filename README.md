# Blogtion
Blogtion is a simple integration between Notion and static blog generator websites. There are lot of static site  generator websites that are being to create bloging websites. 
Well the propasal is very simple to generate .md files which would then appear on your blog website. Well often times I end up using notion to draft initial version of my blog.
Notion is a great tool to manage your tasks and is also more intuitive then writing a .md file. As transfering the final draft to github became a task I came up with this integration where
as soon as we mark the blog `done` in Notion it appears on our blog website.

## Notion setup
The Notion setup can look like below where there are some blogs which are marked as `In progress` and some as `done`.
